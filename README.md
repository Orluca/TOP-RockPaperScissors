# TOP-RockPaperScissors

My first finished webpage, following the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" exercise from "The Odin Project".

Things that I learned:

- some basic JavaScript, including simple algorithms and basic DOM manipulation
- building and designing a basic page layout with CSS and HTML
- for fun, a bit of animations with CSS
