# TOP-RockPaperScissors

My first finished webpage, following the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" exercise from "The Odin Project".

### Things that I learned:

- Some basic JavaScript, including simple algorithms and basic DOM manipulation
- Building and designing a basic page layout with CSS and HTML
- For fun, a bit of animations with CSS

### Current Issues:

- The code still seems very messy and could probably be cleaned up and refactored quite a bit. More comments would also be good.
- Animations should probably be cancelled and reset if you press the buttons really fast.
- Design wise, things don't feel 100% centered (I think one of the reasons could be the emojis, which seem to act a bit weird in that regard).
- Not optimized for smaller screens/mobile devices at all (I think _media queries_ would be used for that).
